Instructions: The following set of questions will ask about how people in your household are getting along. Some of the questions ask about familiesâ€™ conflict, which is normal and common. None of the questions in this survey meet the threshold for reporting maltreatment. Our goal is to understand how coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is impacting family functioning, across all of the families who take this survey.

Occurrence indicates what weeks the questions in this module were asked.
